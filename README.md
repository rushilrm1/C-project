# Custom String Class Implementation in Modern C++

A custom implementation of a **String class in modern C++**, created to understand how string operations, dynamic memory management, operator overloading, and object-oriented programming work internally.

This project provides a hands-on implementation of string functionality without relying entirely on the standard `std::string` class.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a custom String class from scratch and explore the concepts behind string management in C++.

The project focuses on:

* Dynamic memory allocation
* Character array manipulation
* Constructors and destructors
* Copying and assignment
* Operator overloading
* String concatenation
* String comparison
* Indexing and character access
* Object-oriented programming concepts
* Memory management using modern C++ practices

## ✨ Features

The custom String class is designed to provide functionality similar to a basic C++ string.

### Core Operations

* Create strings from character arrays
* Copy strings
* Assign one string to another
* Concatenate strings
* Compare strings
* Access individual characters
* Find string length
* Display string contents

### C++ Concepts Demonstrated

This project demonstrates practical use of:

* Classes and objects
* Constructors
* Destructors
* Copy constructors
* Assignment operators
* Operator overloading
* Dynamic memory allocation
* Encapsulation
* Resource management

## 🛠️ Requirements

To compile and run this project, you need:

* A C++ compiler
* C++11 or later
* Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

Recommended compilers:

* GCC
* Clang
* MSVC

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rushilrm1/Custom-String-Class-Implementation-in-Modern-C-.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project

```bash
cd Custom-String-Class-Implementation-in-Modern-C-
```

### 3. Compile

Using GCC:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 string_cpp_project.cpp -o string_project
```

### 4. Run

Linux/macOS:

```bash
./string_project
```

Windows:

```bash
string_project.exe
```

## 💡 Example

A custom string class can be used in a way similar to:

```cpp
String str1("Hello");
String str2("World");

String result = str1 + str2;

cout << result << endl;
```

> The exact syntax depends on the operators and functions implemented in `string_cpp_project.cpp`.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project was created to strengthen understanding of:

1. How strings can be implemented internally.
2. How dynamic memory is allocated and released.
3. How copy constructors work.
4. How assignment operators can be overloaded.
5. How operator overloading makes custom classes easier to use.
6. How C++ manages resources through object lifetime.
7. How a standard-library-like class can be designed from scratch.

## 🔍 Why Build a Custom String Class?

Although C++ provides `std::string`, implementing a string class manually is an excellent way to understand what happens behind the scenes.

It helps build a stronger understanding of:

* Pointers
* Character arrays
* Heap memory
* Object lifetime
* Copy semantics
* Resource ownership
* Operator overloading
* C++ class design

## 🚧 Future Improvements

Possible future improvements include:

* [ ] Add move constructor
* [ ] Add move assignment operator
* [ ] Implement `operator[]`
* [ ] Add `size()` / `length()`
* [ ] Add `c_str()`
* [ ] Add substring functionality
* [ ] Add search functionality
* [ ] Add input stream support
* [ ] Add output stream support
* [ ] Improve exception safety
* [ ] Add unit tests
* [ ] Add CMake build support
* [ ] Improve documentation
